# SPARC Phase 1: Specification

## Project: KB Query CLI - Natural Language SPARQL Interface

### Executive Summary
Build a command-line interface that enables users to query RDF knowledge bases using natural language, automatically converting their queries to SPARQL based on OWL ontology structure.

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Features
1. **Natural Language Query Processing**
   - Accept queries like "meetings with John Smith"
   - Convert to valid SPARQL based on ontology
   - No SPARQL knowledge required from users

2. **Grammar Generation**
   - Pre-process OWL vocabulary files
   - Generate query patterns from ontology structure
   - Cache grammar for performance

3. **Multi-Profile Support**
   - Configure multiple endpoints (dev/prod)
   - Store credentials securely
   - Switch profiles easily

4. **Interactive Mode**
   - REPL interface for continuous querying
   - Query history within session
   - Immediate feedback on errors

5. **CLI Mode**
   - Direct command execution: `kb-query "query text"`
   - Scriptable interface
   - Exit codes for automation

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- Grammar generation < 5 seconds for typical ontology
- Query parsing < 100ms
- SPARQL execution timeout configurable per profile

#### Usability
- Clear error messages with suggestions
- Optional SPARQL display for learning
- Debug mode for troubleshooting
- ASCII table output for results

#### Security
- Credentials stored securely
- Support for environment variables
- Basic auth over HTTPS

#### Compatibility
- Python 3.8+
- Linux/macOS/Windows support
- XDG Base Directory compliance

### User Stories

1. **As a knowledge worker**, I want to query my knowledge base using natural language so I don't need to learn SPARQL.

2. **As a developer**, I want to test queries against different endpoints so I can verify changes before production.

3. **As a data analyst**, I want to see the generated SPARQL so I can learn the query language gradually.

4. **As a system administrator**, I want credentials stored securely so sensitive data remains protected.

### Constraints

1. Must maintain compatibility with existing `KBQueryEngine` design patterns
2. Grammar generation must be deterministic and cacheable
3. Core service must be testable in isolation
4. Configuration follows XDG standards

### Success Criteria

1. Users can query knowledge base without SPARQL knowledge
2. Switching between dev/prod endpoints is seamless
3. Error messages guide users to valid queries
4. All components have >80% test coverage
5. Documentation includes clear examples

### Out of Scope (MVP)

- Query result pagination
- Export to CSV/JSON files
- CONSTRUCT/INSERT/DELETE operations
- Query templates with parameters
- Web interface
- Query history persistence

### Dependencies

- Existing ontology parser and pattern generator modules
- RDFLib for ontology processing
- SPARQLWrapper for endpoint communication
- Click/Typer for CLI framework
- Rich for table formatting

### Risks

1. **Risk**: Large ontologies may take long to process
   - **Mitigation**: Implement robust caching strategy

2. **Risk**: Natural language ambiguity in queries
   - **Mitigation**: Provide suggestions and debug mode

3. **Risk**: Network failures during query execution
   - **Mitigation**: Configurable timeouts and retry logic
